# üéØ Problem Statement
This project uses a dataset with key health indicators across countries to explore global health trends. We analyze factors such as health expenditure, life expectancy, mortality rates, and disease prevalence to uncover insights that could shape health policy and improve outcomes, especially in underrepresented regions.

---

# üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Overview
The dataset contains global health indicators spanning multiple years. Key features include:

## 1. Country & Time Data
- **`country`**: Country name (e.g., "USA")
- **`country_code`**: ISO country code (e.g., "US")
- **`year`**: Year of data reporting

## 2. Health Indicators
- **`health_exp`**: Health expenditure (% of GDP)
- **`life_expect`**: Life expectancy at birth (total years)
- **`maternal_mortality`**: Maternal mortality rate (deaths per 100,000 live births)
- **`infant_mortality`**: Infant mortality rate (deaths per 1,000 live births)
- **`neonatal_mortality`**: Neonatal mortality rate (deaths per 1,000 live births)
- **`under_5_mortality`**: Under-5 mortality rate (deaths per 1,000 live births)
- **`prev_hiv`**: Prevalence of HIV (% of population)
- **`inci_tuberc`**: Tuberculosis incidence (cases per 100,000 people)
- **`prev_undernourishment`**: Prevalence of undernourishment (% of population)

# üìç Target Variable
**Indicator Values**: Each row represents a health indicator for a given country in a specific year. The dataset provides insights into global health trends and relationships between health factors across countries.

# ‚ú® Dataset Insights
- The dataset spans multiple countries and years, offering a longitudinal view of global health.
- Indicators such as health expenditure, life expectancy, and mortality rates help understand global health outcomes.
- The target variables focus on health outcomes like mortality rates and disease prevalence.

---

# üìà Visualization Insights
We will visualize the data using several plots to reveal global health trends, including:

- **Histograms** to compare health expenditures and mortality rates across countries.
- **Line plots** to observe trends in life expectancy and maternal mortality over time.
- **Correlation heatmaps** to explore relationships between health spending, life expectancy, and disease prevalence.

## Discussion and Conclusion
In this notebook, we explored the World Health Indicators dataset, focusing on cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure its readiness for further analysis. We handled missing values, corrected data inconsistencies, and performed necessary transformations to improve the dataset‚Äôs quality. The exploratory data analysis (EDA) provided valuable insights into the relationships between various health indicators and life expectancy.

While this analysis focused on understanding the dataset through visualization and statistical exploration, future work could involve building predictive models to estimate life expectancy based on these health indicators. Advanced machine learning models, such as decision trees or neural networks, could provide a more robust framework for predicting life expectancy, leveraging non-linear relationships between variables that a simple linear model may miss.

The limitations of this analysis include the exclusion of potential confounding factors, such as healthcare infrastructure and lifestyle habits, which were not included in the dataset. Future analyses could integrate these additional variables to provide a more comprehensive understanding of life expectancy determinants.

In conclusion, the exploration of the dataset has provided a solid foundation for understanding the factors that influence life expectancy. The insights gained from this initial analysis can inform future steps, including the development of predictive models and policy recommendations aimed at improving global health outcomes.
